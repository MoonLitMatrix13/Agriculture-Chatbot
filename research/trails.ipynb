Instead farmers today have \\na world market to serve. But the new chances bring new challenges. Farmers and agricultural enterprises, \\nwilling to be part of the new expanding world market, not only have to take into consideration customers’ \\npreferences whom they want to serve, but also adhere to international trade regulations set by WTO and \\ncomply with high production and quality standards required by the importing countries.\\nAgriculture contributes around 17% to GDP and continues to be among the most important and success-\\nful sectors in India. Around 58% of the Indian population depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Apart \\nfrom delivering the local industries with top quality raw materials for processing, agriculture provides \\nalmost 10% of total export earnings. However, to support the impressive Indian economic growth in the \\ncoming years, agriculture will have to contribute more towards value addition, productivity enhancement, \\nhigh quality products and trained manpower to successfully tackle these challenges.\\nThe states of Gujarat and Maharashtra have competitive advantages for the production of several com-\\nmodities. However, productivity and competitiveness remains low. Rising quality requirements of export \\nand domestic markets require an up-scaling of the production which is only feasible with educated farmers \\nand skilled workers.\\nDesai Fruits and Vegetables (DFV)in cooperation with the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale \\nZusammenarbeit(GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and \\nDevelopment (BMZ) takes up the existing education gap by implementing a development partnership \\ncalled “Partnership Farming India” .\\nThe goal of Partnership Farming India (PFI) is to enable farmers to be self-sufficient decision-makers, \\n“agripreneurs” , which allows for a more flexible production system and highlights farming as profession by \\nchoice and not by inheritance. \\nFurthermore, PFI strengthens farmers’ and farm workers’ management skills to adopt modern agricul-\\ntural practices and concepts and enhance the international competitiveness of smallholders’ agricultural \\nproduce by giving farmers and workers in Gujarat and Maharashtra access to practical agricultural educa-\\ntion. Therefore, DFV and GIZ in close cooperation with the National Institute of Agricultural Extension \\nManagement (MANAGE, an organization of Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India) developed the \\ntraining material on basic agricultural knowledge and skills.\\nThe states of Gujarat and Maharashtra will serve as an example on how to establish long term successful \\nand trustful business relationships by combining small scale production in the field with large scale pro-\\ncessing and marketing. I am confident that this effort will serve the Indian agriculture as a replicable model \\nmake lasting contributions towards sustainable agriculture and prosperous farmers.\\nI would like to express my sincere gratitude to the people and institutions namely MANAGE, DFV and \\nGIZ,which supported this project and enabled making information available.

Research and Extension systems play major role in generation \\nand dissemination of Agricultural technologies aiming at enhancing the income of farmers. The extension \\nsystem adopts series of extension methods such as Training, demonstration, exposure visit to transfer \\nthe technologies from lab to land. Majority of these extension efforts mainly focus on location and crop \\nspecific technologies, and mostly on solution to problem basis. However, there is a need for equipping the \\nfarmers with Basic knowledge of Agriculture in order to create a better knowledge platform at farmer level \\nfor taking appropriate farm management decisions and to absorb modern technologies.  \\nIn view of this, Desai Fruits and Vegetables Pvt. Ltd. (DFV), India, in cooperation with the Deutsche \\nGesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry \\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) in close cooperation with National Institute of Ag-\\nricultural Extension Management (MANAGE- An Organization of Ministry of Agriculture, Government \\nof India) brought out Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture to impart technical knowledge on Basic \\nAgriculture to farmers to provide holistic perspective of scientific Agriculture.\\nThis handbook is a product of series of brainstorming workshops and consultative meetings with various \\nstakeholders such as Researchers, Academicians, Extension Functionaries, Agripreneurs, Master Trainers \\nand Farmers. Based on the identified needs, the topics were prioritized and contents were developed with \\nthe help of experts. The farmer-friendly content has been written in simple language, using more pictures \\nwith practical examples for the benefit of farmers. \\nThe book contains six chapters, each focusing on a particular topic. The first chapter, “General conditions \\nfor cultivation of crops” , talks about the basic needs of farmers and farming sector, by providing basic \\nknowledge on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), enhancing the awareness of farmers on critical factors \\nin selection of crops and cropping patterns, judicious use of natural resources such as soil and water, and \\nemphasizing the importance of mechanization in the field of agriculture.\\nThe second chapter “Soil and Plant Nutrition” is aimed at increasing the awareness and understanding of \\nfarmers about soil, it’s structure, physical, chemical, biological properties, soil fertility and managing the \\nsoil fertility in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. It also focuses on the need for \\nsoil testing, plant nutrition requirement, organic & inorganic fertilizers, and Integrated Nutrient Manage-\\nment (INM) for efficient, economic and sustainable production of crops.\\nThe third chapter of the book is about Pest Management, and focuses on enhancing the awareness of and \\nunderstanding among farmers about the crop pests, diseases and weed management through Integrated \\nPest Management. It also aims at sensitizing farmers on safe handling of chemicals and plant protection \\nequipments as also elaborated further in the fifth chapter on “Occupational health and safety of farmers” . \\nIt creates awareness about causes, preventive measures of health hazards, risks & fatalities in agriculture, \\nand use of first aid in emergencies. It further includes safety tips and care to reduce the risk of injuries and \\nfatalities while handling machineries and pesticides by farmers.\\nTime and resources management is an integral part of each and every activity, be it service sector, busi-\\nness or day-to-day activities of life. Farming sector too has not remained untouched by it. Therefore, the \\nfourth chapter of the book is devoted to “Farm Management” . It is to educate and equip the farmers to \\nmake proper plans, take appropriate decisions and also to take advantage of the improved technologies \\nto increase production, assure food security for the family and market opportunities to increase income \\nconsidering available resources, anticipated risks, including market fluctuations.\\n“Farmer’s access to services” , the last chapter of the book, aims at enhancing awareness among farmers \\nabout sources of extension, information and services, public and private extension services, agricultural \\ncredit, insurance and legal aspects through Information & Communication Technologies. The content is \\nuseful not only for farmers but also for other stakeholders involved in farm advisory services such as Agri \\ninput dealers, Agripreneurs, Kisan Call Centers and extension functionaries working at grass roots level. \\nWe trust that this Handbook will benefit maximum number of farmers to make farming economically and \\nenvironmentally more sustainable.\\nB.

Hence, basin irrigation \\nis the best method to use for this kind of \\ncrop.\\n•\\t Trees can also be grown in basins, where \\none tree is usually located in the middle of a \\nsmall basin.\\n•\\t In general, the basin method is suitable for \\ncrops that are no affected by standing in \\nwater for longer periods. \\n•\\t Basin irrigation is suitable for many field \\ncrops. \\n•\\t Crops suitable for basin irrigation include \\npastures, citrus, banana and crops that are \\nbroadcasted such as cereals and to some \\nextent row crops such as tobacco.\\n•\\t Basin irrigation is generally not suited to \\ncrops, which cannot stand in wet or water-\\nlogged conditions for periods longer than 24 \\nhours; eg: potatoes, beet root and carrots \\n•\\t The flatter the land surface, the easier it is to \\nconstruct basins. \\n•\\t It is also possible to construct basins on \\nsloping land, even when the slope is quite \\nsteep. Level basins, called terraces, can be \\nconstructed like the steps of a staircase.\\n•\\t Soils suitable for basin irrigation depend on \\nthe crop grown. \\nBasin should be small if the:\\n•\\tSlope of the land is steep\\n•\\t Soil is sandy\\n•\\t Stream size to the basin is small\\n•\\t Required depth of the irrigation application \\nis small\\n•\\t Field preparation is done by hand or animal \\npower\\nBasin can be large if the:\\n•\\tSlope of the land is gentle or flat\\n•\\t Soil is clay\\n•\\t Stream size to the basin is large\\n•\\t Required depth of the irrigation application \\nis large\\n•\\t Field preparation is mechanized\\n•\\t The land slope, the soil type, the available \\nstream size, the required depth of the ir-\\nrigation application and farming practices \\nmainly determine the shape and size of \\nbasins\\n•\\t If the land slope is steep, the basin should be \\nnarrow; otherwise too much earth move-\\nment will be needed to obtain level basins. \\n•\\t Three other factors, which may affect basin \\nwidth, are depth of fertile soil, method of \\nbasin construction, agricultural practices.\\n•\\t There are two methods to supply irrigation \\nwater to basins: (i) The direct method: Ir-\\nrigation water is led directly from the field \\nchannel into the basin through siphons,'),\n",

Soil Analysis: Key to a Successful \\nNutrient Management Plan\\nH\\nigher crop yields and quality of \\nthe crops depend largely on the ef-\\nficient supply of nutrients. Soil provides \\nnot only the medium but also functions \\nas the source of these nutrients for the \\nplants. Soil resources get depleted with \\nevery harvest and need to be replenished \\nfor every crop. However, one must know \\nwhich nutrients are to what extent deplet-\\ned and what addition of fertilizers should \\nbe planned accordingly. Soil analysis, in \\nthis regard, helps in determining the level \\nof nutrients and in deciding the required \\namount of fertilizer application.\\nAccuracy of soil analysis is directly relat-\\ned to the quality of the soil sample taken. \\nApplication of appropriate fertilizers with \\nthe proper nutrient mix will help not only \\nto increase the productivity and farm in-\\ncome but also provide a more realistic \\nchance to obtain the desired yield. There \\nare various methods for taking a soil sam-\\nple from a field.

Plant Analysis\\nP\\nlant Analysis is the second tool, after soil test-\\ning that is critical to improve crop nutrition and \\nyield. Only plant analysis can identify the actual \\nnutrient status of a plant or crop. While soil testing \\nidentifies the nutrients offered to the crop or plants, \\nPlant analysis identifies how well the plants utilizes \\nthe soil nutrients and applied nutrients. Plant analy-\\nsis allows the plant to tell us what nutrients it needs.\\n It is critical that the correct plant part and stage of \\ngrowth be sampled. The normal nutrient concentra-\\ntion differs between the various plant parts. Also, \\nthe normal nutrient concentration of each plant \\npart changes as the plant matures.

Irrigation Water Analysis\\nI\\nrrigation water, irrespective of its source, always \\ncontains some soluble salts. The suitability of wa-\\nters for a specific purpose depends upon the types \\nand amounts of dissolved salts. Some of the dis-\\nsolved salts or other constituents may be useful for \\ncrops but the quality or suitability of water for irri-\\ngation purposes is assessed in terms of the presence \\nof undesirable constituents. Some of the dissolved \\nions such as NO3 are useful for crops.\\nThe most important characteristic that de-\\ntermine the quality of irrigation water are:\\n•\\t pH\\n•\\t Total concentration of soluble salts are judged \\nthrough Electrical Conductivity (EC).\\n•\\t Relative proportion of sodium to other cations \\nsuch as Ca and Mg are referred to as      Sodium \\nAdsorption Ratio (SAR).\\n•\\t Concentration of boron or other elements that \\nmay be toxic to plants.\\n•\\t Concentration of carbonates and bi-carbonate \\nas related to the concentration of calcium plus \\nmagnesium are referred to as Residual Sodium \\nCarbonate (RSC).\\n•\\t Content of anions such as chloride, sulphate \\nand nitrate.\\nMethods of water sample collection\\nAs water quality and suitability plays an important \\nrole in deciding production and productivity of \\ncrops, farmers are advised consult extension worker \\nto test the water.\\nNutrient re-\\nquirement and \\nproductivity\\nKeeping soil \\nfertility and \\nsoil nutrients \\nat optimum \\nlevel helps in-\\ncreasing the \\nproductiv-\\nity of the soil. \\nAlthough the \\nability of the \\nsoil to supply \\nthe plants with \\nthe required \\nnutrients depends also on the soil condition like i.e. \\nsoil texture, soil structure and soil organic matter. \\nTherefore, soil fertility management does not only \\ninclude nutrient management but also soil condi-\\ntion management. \\nApart from other soil management practices, \\nsoil fertility focuses on:\\n•\\t Maintain a balance between nutrient uptake \\nand nutrient application.\\n•\\t Adequate fertility for the plants at the specific \\ngrowth stages.\\n•\\t Soil fertility and organic matter maintenance\\n•\\t Minimizing the nutrient loss by avoiding excess \\napplication.'),\n",

India produces about \\n26.217 MT of banana from an area of 0.709 Mha with an average productivity of 37.0 mt/ha. \\nMajor producing states are Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, As-\\nsam and Madhya Pradesh. Tamil Nadu has 0.1244 mha under banana and the total production \\nduring 2008-09 is 6.667 Mmt with 53.6 mt/ha productivity. In Gujarat, banana crop is cultivated \\nin 11 districts covering an area of about 60900 ha. Gujarat is ranking 3rd among the states of India \\nwith an average productivity of 58.7t/ha. Unripe fruits are used for making chips, vegetable flour, \\netc. Ripened fruits are used for preparing drink, jam, beer, salad, etc. Banana fruits are having \\nnumerous medicinal uses (as per Ayurveda). From psedostem threads are obtained and used for \\nmaking rope and cloths.  \\nPrevailing Varieties: Basarai, Lokhandi, Robasta, Shreemanti and Grand Naine.\\nClimate: Banana grows well in warm and humid climate with an average temperature of 27oC \\nand rainfall of 2,000 to 2,500 mm. However, it requires assured irrigation facility.\\nSoil type suitability: Loamy and salty clay loam soils with good fertility status are best suited \\nfor banana cultivation. However, extremely clayey and sandy soils are not suitable for banana crop.\\nLand preparation: The land should be ploughed, harrowed and planked to achieve levelled \\nfields. For planting banana, dugout a pit of 30 x 30 x 30 cm size at a spacing of 1.5 x 1.5 m.\\nSoil sterilization: After land preparation, the pits should be exposed to the sunlight for 10 to \\n15 days. In the case of heavy infestation of soil born pest and diseases, the soil solarization should \\nbe done using transparent plastic for a period of 15 to 20 days during summer season (preferably \\nduring May).\\nTime of plating: Optimum time for planting is 15th June to 15th July. Banana planting is done \\neither by suckers or tissue culture plant.\\nSuckers: Suckers should be selected from a healthy field of banana. Sufficient care should be \\ntaken that suckers should not be damaged during digging and transport. Fresh sucker, weighing \\nabout 500 to 1,500 g, should be selected. For control of fungal diseases, suckers should be dipped \\nin a solution of aurofugine1 (10 g / 100 litres of water) for 1.5 hour prior to planting.\\nTissue culture plant: Select healthy and uniform plants.\\nIrrigation and scheduling: The water requirement of banana crop by surface method of ir -\\nrigation (25-30 irrigations) is 1,500-1,800 mm.

Major producing \\nstates are Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Orissa & \\nMaharashtra. Uttar Pradesh has 0.2712 mha under mango and the total production during 2008-\\n09 is 3.465 Mt with 12.8 mt/ha productivity. India ranks first in the world for mango production \\nand area under cultivation. Mango is a rich source of vitamin A and has a fairly good content of \\nvitamin C. Mango fruits are used for preparation of pickle, chatani, amchur, jam, squash, nectar \\nand many other delicious products. \\nClimate and soil: Mango can be grown from alluvial to lateritic soils except black cotton soil \\nwhich has poor drainage. The temperature between 24 and 270C is ideal for mango cultivation.\\nVariety: Dashehari, Langra, Chausa, Bombay Green, Lucknow Safeda, Mallika and Amrapali.\\nMultiplication of genuine planting material: Mango can be propagated by veneer, wedge \\nand soft wood grafting. The protected nurseries in polyhouses and use of sprinkler and drip is \\nbecoming common for raising humidity level, which is required for higher grafting success rate. \\nPreparation of land: The land should be prepared one month before planting. The pits of 1m x \\n1m x 1m size are dug. The pits are exposed for 2 to 4 weeks to kill harmful soil organisms.\\nSoil sterilization: Soil sterilization can be achieved through both physical and chemical means. \\nPhysical control measures include steam and solar energy. Chemical control methods include her-\\nbicides and fumigants. Soil sterilization can also be achieved by using transparent plastic mulch \\nfilm (25 micron thickness) termed as soil solarisation.\\nPlanting: Square and rectangular systems are popular. Before planting, pits are filled with FYM \\nat the rate of 15-20 kg/plant. The grafts should be planted during July to September.\\nPlanting density: High density (3m x 6m or 5m x 5m) planting helps increase the yield/unit \\narea. Normal planting distance of mango is 8m x 8m.\\nCanopy Management: Training should be done after 6th month of planting. It is essential to \\nspace the branches properly and to help in intercultural operation. At initial branching height be-\\ntween 60 to 70 cm is appropriate.\\nWater requirement of the crop \\nAge of the plant Water requirement of the crop in litres/day/tree\\nY oung plant (up to 3 years) 9-12 lts\\n3-6 years 30-35 lts\\n6-10 years 50-60 lts\\n9-12 years 80-90 lts\\nFully grown trees 120    lts\\nA young tree requires 2 drippers at a distance of 1m on lateral lines, while fully-grown tees require \\n2 drippers with double lateral lines at 1-1.5 m distance.\\nMango'),\n",

To control the fruit drop that occurs after fruit set, two foliar sprays of \\neither 2,4-D or GA3 at 15 ppm + urea 1% and copper oxychloride2 (0.3%) at monthly intervals in \\nApril – May are recommended. Same spray concentration is recommended for controlling pre-\\nharvest drop in the months of September and October. 2,4-D and GA3 may be dissolved earlier in \\nlittle quantity (30 – 40 ml for 1g) of some organic solvent such as alcohol or acetone before making \\nthe spray solution.  \\nControl of Insect Pests \\nBlackfly (Kolshi): Nymphs of citrus blackfly attack the young flush, suck the sap and excrete \\nsweet and sticky liquid, which favours rapid development of black sooty mould that covers entire \\nplant surface. The process of photosynthesis is hampered greatly resulting in stunted growth of \\nplants, low intensity of flowering, scarce fruiting which are insipid in taste and decline of citrus \\norchard sets. For control of blackfly two sprays of insecticides viz. acetamiprid 0.2 g/litre water \\nshould be given at 50% egg hatching stage that normally occurs in the II weed of July and the I \\nweek of December and April. One additional spray which targets the adult blackfly population \\nwhen it is as its peak helps tremendously in controlling the pest. \\nMethod of spraying: Spraying should be directed at the underside of the leaf, ensuring the \\ncomplete drenching of the tree. For proper coverage and penetration of canopy, use of power \\nsprayers for spraying operation should be envisaged. Insecticides should be used alternatively for \\nbetter results. \\nCitrus psylla: Numerous young brownish nymphs of psylla are seen crawling on the young \\nflush. Several dirty gray colour adults can be seen sitting in line with tails upwards. Voluminous \\ndesapping by the nymphs results into the drop of flush, flowers and berries. Affected branches \\ndry and die-back sets in. The nymphs also excrete white crystalline powder, which invites fungal \\ninfestation. Psylla can be controlled by spraying acetamiprid 0.2 g/litre water twice with 10 days \\ninterval during the initial days of flushing. Bark eating caterpillar (Larva) are incidence of mites \\non fruits (Lalya).\\nLeaf miner: Serpentine mines are seen on the new leaves and also young stems are mined when \\nthe incidence is severe. At times death of young shoots may occur. The problem is quite serious in \\nnursery and in young orchard. To control citrus leaf miners, spray either imidacloprid 5 ml (To be \\nused in proper doses under guidance of an agriculture expert) and thiamethoxam 0.2g/litre water. \\nBark eating caterpillar: The pest is noticed predominantly in the older and ignored orchards. \\nThe hanging wooden frass and tunnel at the joint of two branches during October – April indicates \\nthe presence of the pest. Larva remains hidden inside the tunnel during daytime and becomes \\nactive in the night and feeds on the bark nearby the tunnel. This results into snapping of food sup-\\nply, ultimately yellowing of leaves on the branch and its slow decline. For control of the pest the \\nwooden frass should be cleaned and each tunnel should be administered with Emamectin benzo-\\nate/spinosad @0.4 ml/litre water. \\nFruit sucking moth: The moth attacks the ripening fruits during late hours in the evening.

Pest cause damage to the plant to \\nthe extent of 30 - 90 per cent, sometimes it even \\ncauses total loss. Pest includes insects, diseases and \\nweeds. Non insect pest includes nematodes, snails \\nand rodents.\\nInsect is any of many small invertebrate animals \\nhaving a segmented body and three pairs of legs and \\nusually two pairs of wings. Some insects are benefi-\\ncial and some are harmful to agriculture. \\nWhat is the difference between  \\ncomplete and incomplete metamor-\\nphosis in insects?\\nIncomplete and complete metamorphosis differs \\nin the number of life cycle stages that insects go \\nthrough during their transformation from egg to \\nadult. The complete metamorphosis has 4 life cycle \\nstages and an incomplete metamorphosis has 3 life \\ncycle stages.\\nComplete metamorphosis\\nComplete metamorphosis has four distinct life cy-\\ncle stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult.\\nExamples of insects that go through complete \\nmetamorphosis are butterflies, silkworms, meal-\\nworms and ladybugs. The larva can be worm-like \\neven though the six legs are still visible. The larva \\nform moths and butterflies are called caterpillars. \\nMaggots are the larval stage of flies. The larvae eat \\nconstantly and grow rapidly. A hard, protective case \\nforms around the larva at pupa stage. The pupa \\nstage for a butterfly is called a chrysalis. The pupa \\nstage for moth is called cocoon.\\nIncomplete metamorphosis\\nIncomplete metamorphosis has three life cycle stag-\\nes: egg, nymph and adult. The nymph looks similar \\ntoo but is a smaller version of the adult. The nymph \\nis also wingless. Examples are grasshoppers, cock-\\nroaches, ants and praying mantids.\\n3.4.

They are called \\nbiological control agents. Examples are the \\ntrichogramma parasite for sugarcane borers, \\ncrub of green lacewing and ladybird beetle.\\n3.5. Insect classification\\nI\\nnsects can be classified into 3 groups, depending \\non their behaviour in the farm such as\\n•\\t Pests\\n•\\t Beneficial insects\\n•\\t Neutral insects\\nPest: Whether an insect species is a pest or not \\ndepends on the situation. This means that a cer -\\ntain insect could be a pest in one situation but not \\nin another situation. For example, the caterpillars \\nof diamondback moth feed on cabbage and other \\nplants of the cruciferae family. A farmer who grows \\ncauliflower will therefore consider it a pest. Y et, for \\na farmer who grows potatoes or bananas, the dia-\\nmondback moth is a neutral insect. When there is \\nnothing to feed it will not even occur. In a paddy \\ncrop, black gram is a weed/pest since it is growing \\nunnecessarily. In a black gram field, cow pea is a \\nweed since it can grow. Pest will occur only if there \\nis a host.\\nBeneficial insects\\nSome insects are beneficial to the farmer, because \\nthey are the natural enemies of harmful insects. \\nPredators feed on other insects and hence control \\nthe pest. For example, the assassin bug kills caterpil-\\nlars and ladybird beetles feed on aphids. Some oth-\\ner insects are beneficial as they help in pollination \\nof plants, e.g. honey bees. There are commercially \\nbeneficial insects such as silkworm, which produces \\nsilk.\\nNeutral insects\\nA neutral insect is neither a pest nor beneficial. Y et \\nagain, it really depends on the context. A mosquito \\nin the rice field can be considered as neutral insect. \\n \\n3.6. How to control pest\\nNatural control\\nUnderstanding insect life cycle: Insects mul-\\ntiply in large numbers. However the survival rate \\nis very less as the nature maintains insect popula-\\ntion. Factors like extreme temperature, heavy rains, \\nheavy wind, water stagnation, birds, lizards, spiders, \\nanimals, other insects and diseases control the pest. \\nNatural barriers like sea, river, lake, mountains, etc. \\nprevent movement and spread of pest.\\nMechanical control: Some of the recommended \\npractices are\\n•\\t Removal of affected parts \\n•\\t Collection and destruction of insects \\n•\\t Drying of seeds\\n•\\t Tar coating of trees to protect from termites \\n•\\t Provision of barriers to prevent the entry of \\npests like green house / screen house, covering \\nof pomegranate fruits with butter paper, etc.\\n•\\t Clipping off the withered shoots\\nAgronomical methods: Recommended culti-\\nvation practices are as follows. \\n•\\t Summer ploughing:  Opens up the soil and ex-\\nposes pest to hot sun and predators. \\n•\\t Trap crop: Is growing the most favoured crop of \\nthe insect along with the main crop. The insect \\nfeeds from the trap crop and the main crop re-\\nmains not unaffected. Growing of resistant va-\\nrieties also prevents the pest attack.\\nMain Crop Trap Crop\\nTomato Marigold\\nCotton Okra, Castor, Onion, Garlic\\nMaize Sorghum\\n•\\t Mixed cropping: Is growing more than one crop.\\n•\\t Inter cropping: Growing another crop along \\nwith main crop, which increases the population \\nof natural enemy.\\nMain Crop Intercrop\\nCabbage Tomato, mustard\\nCotton Black gram, green gram\\nMaize Sorghum\\n•\\t Crop Rotation: Is growing of different crops in'),\n",

Pesticides\\nP\\nesticides are the chemicals used to control pests. \\nThe pesticides can be broadly classified into \\nthree groups based on how they act on insects.\\nContact and stomach poison: When insect \\ncomes into contact or when the insect eats the pesti-\\ncide sprayed parts, it gets killed. Contact and stom-\\nach poison is used for controlling larvae that feed \\non leaves. Examples include Flubendamide. Some \\nof the pesticides derived from plants also have con-\\ntact action, for example pyrethrum, sabadilla, etc.  \\nSystemic poison: When the chemical is sprayed \\non the plant, it is absorbed by the plant and trans-\\nferred to the entire plant system. Sucking type of \\npest like aphids, leafhoppers thrips suck the sap \\nfrom plants. This kind of sucking pests can be con-\\ntrolled by systemic poison like Imidacloprid (To \\nbe used with caution), flubendamide, acetamiprid, \\nthiamethoxam, etc. \\n1) Fumigant: Forms vapour and acts on breath-\\ning system of the insects. When insects breathe \\nit, they get killed.  Examples include, hydrogen \\ncyanamide, sulfuryl fluoride, etc.  \\nInsecticides are poisons which cannot be used di-\\nrectly. They need to be used as per directions given \\non the container or as per the recommendation of \\nextension workers. Insecticides are available in dif-\\nferent forms of which some are:\\ni) Dust (D): Poisons are mixed with gypsum, \\ntalc or clay so that it can be used in powder form. \\nThere is no need to mix with water.\\nii) Wettable Powders (WP/WDP):Mixed with \\ndry fillers with sticking agents but these dry \\npowders can be mixed with water.\\niii) Granules (G): Dry formulations in which \\npoisons are mixed with calcium or gypsum in \\ngranulated form. Main merit of this formulation \\nis handling will be easy, it is not carried away by \\nthe wind and it is less toxic to plants.\\niv) Liquid forms, Soluble Liquids (SL), Emulsifi-\\nable Concentrates (EC), and Soluble Concentrates \\n(SC): Liquid forms of pesticides. Since the pesti-\\ncides are directly soluble in water, they are mixed \\nwith organic solvents, EC formulations disperse \\nin water easily as they are mixed with emulsifi-\\ners.\\nv) Fumigants: are the poisons in gas form. \\nNormally it is used to fumigate godowns, grains, \\nstorage rooms and ships even for rat control. \\nvi) Poison baits: Poisons mixed with food mate-\\nrial. The latter acts as attractants. Baits are exclu-\\nsively used to control rats. As the rats are more \\nsensitive, pre baiting is necessary.\\n3.8. Types of chemicals\\n•\\t Organochlorines, Organophosphates, Carba-\\nmates, Synthetic Pyrethroids are types of chem-\\nicals which were used before, but are not rec-\\nommended now.\\n•\\t New Molecules: Invention is a continuous pro-\\ncess to identify more effective and less hazardous \\nchemical search for better insect management. \\nExamples include Nicotinamides, spinozids, \\ntriazoles (Hexaconozole, Propiconozole).\\nManual Pesticide Spraying'),\n",

Disease \\nD\\nisease is an impairment of the normal state \\nof a plant that interrupts or modifies its vital \\nfunctions. All species of plants, wild and cultivated \\nalike are subject to disease. Although each species \\nis susceptible to characteristic diseases, these are, in \\neach case, relatively few in number. The occurrence \\nand prevalence of plant diseases vary from season \\nto season, depending on the presence of the patho-\\ngen, environmental conditions, and the crops and \\nvarieties grown. Some plant varieties are particu-\\nlarly subject to outbreaks of diseases.\\nDisease of crops and their importance \\n•\\t Plant become diseased when it is continuously \\ndisturbed by some causal agent including an \\nabnormal process that disrupts the plants.\\n•\\t There are more than 80,000 plant diseases.\\n•\\t Diseases reduce the yield of the crops and \\nsometimes lead to disaster e.g. late blight of po-\\ntato, Panama of banana, etc.\\n•\\t Managing outbreak of diseases is challenge to \\nthe farmer.\\nCauses of plant disease\\nInfectious diseases: caused due to fungi, bacte-\\nria, viruses, nematodes, etc.\\nNon-infectious diseases: caused due to unfa-\\nvourable extraneous condition such as scorching \\nsunlight, high temperature, moisture stress or defi-\\nciency of micronutrients, pH, heavy metal toxicity, \\natmospheric pollution, etc.\\n3.13. The disease cycle\\nT\\nhe main events of stages comprising the disease \\ncycle include the following: production and \\ndissemination of the primary inoculum, primary \\ninfection, growth and development of the patho-\\ngen, secondary infection and over wintering.\\nThe primary inoculum is the part of the pathogen \\n(that is, bacterial or fungal spores or fungal myce-\\nlium) that over winters (over-seasons) and causes \\nthe first infection of the season, known as primary \\ninfection. In general, the greater the amount of in-\\noculum and the nearer it is to its host, the greater \\nthe potential for a disease epidemic.\\nDissemination refers to the spread or dispersal of \\nthe pathogen from an inoculum source to a host. \\nDissemination can occur by wind, splashing rain, \\ninsects, infested pruning tools, infected or infested \\ntransplants, and other means. Spread can occur \\nover short distances within the tree canopy or from \\ndistant sources. \\nPrimary infection occurs when the pathogen comes \\ninto contact with a susceptible host under favour -\\nable environmental conditions. Pathogens pene-\\ntrate the surface of a plant directly or enter through \\nwounds or natural openings. \\nGrowth and development of a pathogen usually oc-\\ncurs on or within infected plant tissue. \\nSecondary infection results from spores or cells \\nproduced following primary infection or from \\nother secondary infections. The secondary infec-\\ntion cycle can be repeated many times during the \\ngrowing season. The number of cycles is dependent \\non the biology of the pathogen and its host and the \\nduration of environmental conditions needed for \\ninfection. \\nOver wintering or over seasoning is the ability of \\na pathogen to survive from one growing season to \\nthe next. Pathogens of apple survive the winter in a \\nnumber of different ways. \\nFor a plant disease to occur, a susceptible host, a \\npathogen (casual agent), and favourable environ-\\nmental conditions must be present and interact \\nwith one another. If any one of these requirements \\nis not met, a plant disease will not occur. At pre-\\nsent, our ability to manipulate the environment is \\nlimited to only a few practices such as pruning to \\npromote drying, bedding to improve soil drainage, \\nand scheduling of irrigation. Severe disease out-\\nbreaks can be prevented by manipulating the host - \\nthrough the use of resistant cultivars - and the path-\\nogen -- through cultural practices and fungicidal or \\nbactericidal sprays.\\nII.

Nematode management\\nN\\nematodes are thread-like roundworms in-\\nvisible to the naked eye. Species parasitic on \\nplants attack roots and other plant parts, causing \\nstunting and yield reduction. Nematode-infected \\nplants are not only weakened but their root systems \\nare more susceptible to secondary infections by \\nfungi or bacteria. \\nCorrect identification is the first step when a nem-\\natode problem is suspected. The second step is to \\ndetermine whether populations are high enough to \\nthreaten the crop. Root knot nematodes, the most \\ncommon pathogenic nematodes in vegetables, can-\\nnot penetrate roots when soil temperatures are \\nbelow 50 degrees F , and will not reproduce when \\nsoil temperatures are below 58 degrees F . Their re-\\nproductive rate is slower at cooler temperatures, so \\npopulations build up more slowly. Thus, cool sea-\\nson crops are less likely to be damaged. E.g., early \\nspring potatoes, are rarely damaged by nematodes.\\nNematode management practices\\nIsolation: Once a nematode problem is confirmed, \\naffected areas and plants should be isolated because \\ntransplants, machinery and irrigation water can all \\nspread nematode infections. From initially small-\\ninfested areas, nematodes can spread across a field \\nat a rate of 3 feet per year.\\nCrop rotation and cover crops: Crops suscep-\\ntible to root knot nematodes include all cole crop \\nspecies, beans, cucumber, muskmelon, watermelon, \\nbendi, potato, sweet potato and tomato. All pota-\\ntoes are susceptible to nematodes except for a few \\ncultivars resistant to the golden nematode.'),\n",

However you can contact agricultural of-\\nficers of your area along with disease specimen \\nand seek their help in identifying the disease.\\n•\\t Y ou can also give disease-affected plant parts to \\nthe Agri clinics for clinical test before under-\\ntaking control measures.\\n•\\t Follow Integrated Diseases Management such \\nas host plant resistance, agronomic practices, \\njudicious use of fungicides, pesticides for vec-\\ntor control, bio-pesticides for pathogen control \\netc., as indicated below. \\n3.18. Integrated disease management \\npractices in the field\\n•\\t Select varieties and hybrids resistant to the \\nmost common or economically important dis-\\neases in consultation with agricultural officers \\nof your area.\\nFor  example:\\n•\\t Plant only good quality, disease-free seed hav-\\ning good germination. E.g. Cotton seed hav-\\ning above 80% germination will have vigorous \\ngrowth and will not suffer from infection of soil \\nborne diseases\\n•\\t Use seed-treatment with fungicides to control \\ndiseases.\\n•\\t Plant when soil temperature and moisture are \\nmost favourable for specific crop. E.g: If the \\nfarmers take up sowing of cotton during the \\nwarmer temperature (>65 F), there will be bet-\\nter germination and growth.\\n•\\t Avoid planting the same crop in a field year af-\\nter year. E.g.: \\nI) Growing paddy in the Veriticillium wilt in-\\nfested field will reduce the incidence of micro-\\nbial population in the soil.\\nII) Growing Chrysanthemum will inhibit the \\ngrowth of the Veriticillium in the soil.\\n•\\t Incorporate the crop residues of the previous \\ncrop by tilling well before planting season.  E.g. \\nDisease affected plants should be burnt imme-\\ndiately.\\n•\\t Choose right sowing time and maintain ap-\\npropriate plant population by adopting recom-\\nmended spacing.\\n•\\t Apply a balanced fertilizers based on a soil test.  \\nE.g.: Potassium deficiency leads to susceptibil-\\nity of Alternaria leaf spot.\\n•\\t Apply recommended amount of Farmyard Ma-\\nnures/compost at regular intervals and main-\\ntain soil-organic matter content.  E.g.: Over \\ndose of chemical fertilisers lead to more vegeta-\\ntive growth and more disease.\\n•\\t Enrich soil with beneficial micro-organisms \\nlike Trichoderma.\\n•\\t Keep the land weed free. Weeds can serve as \\nalternate hosts for pathogens and helps disease \\ndevelopment. \\n•\\t Timing and duration of irrigation should match \\nthe crop and water requirement without allow-\\ning for excess water. E.g.: Excessive irrigation \\nfavour soil borne pathogen\\n•\\t Maintain insect population below ETL to re-\\nduce the incident of disease transfer by insects. \\n•\\t Regular crop monitoring is essential for effec-\\ntive disease management.\\n•\\t Use bio-pesticide as far as possible to control \\ndisease.

The result indicates whether farm is \\nmaking profit or loss. \\n•\\t The farmer makes a PROFIT or GOOD BUSINESS  if the “Income” is greater than the “Ex-\\npenditure. ” \\n•\\t It is a LOSS, if the “Expenditure” is greater than the “Income. ” In that case it is BAD BUSINESS. \\n•\\t A loss is illustrated by the the minus (dash) and a profit by the plus in front of the number.\\n•\\t A good farmer will abandon loss making crop or use a better technique to make a profit. \\n•\\t To ensure a profit, the farmer needs to visualise Income and Expenditure before production. \\n•\\t The Difference between Income and Expenditure indicates whether we are making a loss or \\nprofit from the use of the land. \\n•\\t The Unit Cost of a crop indicates if it can compete with the same crop produced elsewhere.  \\nIn the case of food crops, the Unit Cost indicates if it is preferable to buy the produce in the \\nmarket. \\n•\\t The good farmer calculates well ahead of the season to decide what to produce and which \\ntechniques to use. \\n•\\t During the production season the good farmer keeps records on money spent for farm opera-\\ntions and inputs. \\n•\\t After the harvest, the good farmer evaluates the profit and identifies what changes are needed \\nto improve the planning and profit for the next production season'),\n",

The profit of the \\nfarmer depends on the price for the produce i.e., whether the Minimum Support Price (MSP) or market \\nrates are prevailing - which are both fluctuating.  \\nThird Step: \\nFill the second financial calendar. The expenditures for inputs and labour are those from the exercise \\nSheets in Module 5 – using improved practices. \\nFourth Step: \\nDiscuss the differences and which situation is preferable. What changes are necessary? \\nMain Lessons\\n•\\t In the agricultural enterprise, expenditure for the farm and the household are incurred every \\nmonth. But the revenue comes only after sale of produce. Therefore there are months of the \\nyear where the expenditures are greater than the revenues. These months are called “deficit \\nm o n t h s .”\\n•\\t For this reason, the good farmer makes a financial calendar. The farmer plans expenditures for \\nproduction and household needs in consultation with his spouse.\\n•\\t To be able to cover the expenditures in deficit months, the good farmer saves money from the \\nsales of produce (“surplus months”). \\n•\\t Improved techniques may contribute to improve the revenues of the farmer. \\n•\\t The needs for inputs can be identified with calculations of gross margin and the financial cal-\\nendar. This information can be used to make savings in a targeted way or to solicit credit for \\nproduction. \\n•\\t The above calculations are done for a farmer with one hectare for Paddy – Paddy combination \\nin Kharif and Rabi for one year. The same exercise should be repeated for taking farm manage-\\nment decisions for the combinations such as\\n•\\t Cotton – Maize (Kharif – Rabi)\\n•\\t Paddy – Maize (Kharif – Rabi)\\n•\\t Maize – Maize (Kharif – Rabi)\\nRisk in Agriculture\\nT\\nhe farmer does not like risks because they are difficult to predict. However, he/she can determine the \\nrisk during the planning so that the impact on revenues could be minimised. For example, Module 4 \\nindicates income and expenditure of paddy, maize and cotton. With available data, Paddy - Paddy is the \\nbest preferred cropping pattern. However, the farmer can make a judicious decision taking prevailing and \\nanticipated risks into considerations. The anticipated risks and possible decisions are as follows:\\nAnticipated Risks Remarks\\nReduction in Paddy Market price by 10% Cotton – Maize is preferred\\nInadequate water due to drought for Paddy - Paddy Cotton – Maize is preferred followed by Maize \\n- Maize. Quantity of water available decides the \\ncropping pattern.'),\n",

Safety tips to reduce the risk of \\ninjuries and fatalities while handling \\nmachineries\\nC\\nontrary to the popular image of fresh air and \\npeaceful surroundings, a farm is not a hazard \\nfree work setting. Every year, thousands of farm \\nworkers are injured and hundreds die in farming \\naccidents. Safety in agriculture is one of the main \\nconcern, especially  when handling with farm tools \\nand machinery. Many accidents in agriculture go \\nunnoticed because they will not be reported. So \\nlearning from mistakes will be less. Safety tips to \\nreduce the risk of injuries and fatalities while han-\\ndling machineries are as follows:\\n•\\t Safety can be improved on farm by increasing \\nawareness of farming hazards and making a \\nconscious effort to prepare for emergency situ-\\nations including fires, vehicle accidents, elec-\\ntrical shocks from equipment and wires and \\nchemical exposures. \\n•\\t Be especially alert to hazards that may affect \\nchildren and the elderly. \\n•\\t Minimize hazards by carefully selecting the \\nproducts to ensure safety.\\n•\\t Always use seat belts when operating tractors.\\n•\\t Read and follow instructions in equipment op-\\nerator’s manuals and on product labels.\\n•\\t Inspect equipment routinely for problems that \\nmay cause accidents.\\n•\\t Discuss safety hazards and emergency proce-\\ndures with all concerned.\\n•\\t Take precautions to prevent entrapment and \\nsuffocation caused by unstable surfaces of \\ngrain storage bins and silos. Never “walk on the \\ngrain. ” \\n•\\t Be aware that methane gas, carbon dioxide, \\nammonia and hydrogen sulfide can form in un-\\nventilated grain silos and manure pits and can \\nsuffocate or poison farmers or explode.\\n•\\t Wear clothing that fits well and is not loose fit-\\nting to avoid being caught in pinch points.'),\n",

Since then, the MSP regime has been expanded to many crops.  \\nMinimum Support Price is the price at which government purchases crops from the farmers,  \\nwhatever may be  the price for the crops.  The MSP is  announced by the  Government of India \\nfor 26 crops currently at the beginning of each season viz. Rabi and Kharif. They are as follows. \\n \\n• Cereals (7) - paddy, wheat, barley, jowar, bajra, maize and ragi \\n• Pulses (5) - gram, arhar/tur, moong, urad and lentil \\n• Oilseeds (8) - groundnut, rapeseed/mustard, toria, soyabean, sunflower seed, sesamum, \\nsafflower seed and nigerseed \\n• Copra \\n• De-husked coconut \\n• Raw cotton \\n• Raw jute \\n• Sugarcane (Fair and remunerative price) \\n• Virginia flu cured (VFC) tobacco \\n \\nObjectives: \\n \\nThe minimum support prices are a guarantee price for their produce from the Government. The  \\nmajor objectives are to support the farmers from distress sales and to procure food grains for  \\npublic distribution. In  case the market price for the  commodity falls  below the announced \\nminimum price due to bumper production and glut in the market, government agencies purchase  \\nthe entire quantity offered by the farmers at the announced minimum price. \\n \\nSalient features: \\n \\nIf there is a fall in the prices of the crops, after a bumper harvest, the government purchases at \\nthe MSP and this is the reason that the priced cannot go below MSP. So this directly helps the  \\nfarmers. \\n \\nThe government decided the support prices for various agricultural commodities after taking into  \\naccount the following: \\n \\n• Recommendations of Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices'),\n",

The scheme  will be \\ndemand-driven and will  facilitate food processing units to meet environmental and safety  \\nstandards. \\n \\nThe expected outcome is increased realization for farmers, creation of high quality processing  \\ninfrastructure, reduction in wastage, capacity building of producers, processors  and creation \\nof an efficient supply chain along with significant direct and indirect employment \\ngeneration. \\n \\nSalient features: \\n \\nThe Scheme aims to facilitate the establishment of a strong food processing industry backed by  \\nan efficient supply chain, which would include collection Centres, primary processing Centres  \\nand cold chain infrastructure. The food processing units, under the scheme, would be located at  \\na Central  Processing Centre (CPC) with need based common  infrastructure required for \\nprocessing, packaging, environmental protection systems, quality control labs, trade facilitation  \\nCentres, etc. \\n \\nThe extent of land required for establishing the CPC is estimated to be between 50-100 \\nacres, though the actual requirement of land would depend upon the business plan of \\ninvestor(s), which may  vary from region to region. CPC would be supported by  Primary \\nProcessing Centres (PPC) and Collection Centres (CCs) in identified locations based on a  \\ntechno-feasibility study, adequate to meet the raw material requirements of the CPC. The \\nland required for setting up of PPCs and CCs at various locations would be in addition to land  \\nrequired for setting up the CPC. \\n \\nIt is expected that, on an average, each project may have around 25 -30 food processing units  \\nwith a collective investment of around Rs. 250 crore that would eventually lead to an annual'),\n",

The Programmed was also renamed  \\nin 1992 as National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programmed (NIDDCP). \\n \\nType of scheme: Central Sector Scheme \\n \\nObjectives of the scheme: \\n \\nIodine is an essential micronutrient required for normal body growth and mental development.  \\nNutritional Iodine Deficiency reckons its impact right from development of the foetus to all ages  \\nof human beings. It could result in abortion, stillbirth, mental retardation, deaf - mutism, squint, \\ndwarfism, goitre, neuromotor defects etc. Iodine deficiency thus, directly affects human resource  \\ndevelopment which in turn greatly influences the human productivity as well as national \\ndevelopment. \\n \\nNational Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP) is being implemented in  \\norder to prevent, control and eliminate these disorders and to provide assistance to the States for  \\nsetting up IDD Cell and IDD monitoring laboratories for ensuring quality control of iodated salt  \\nand for monitoring urinary iodine excretion. Surveys of IDD and health education activities are  \\nalso supported through the Programme. \\n \\nThe important objectives and components of National  Iodine Deficiency Disorders  Control \\nIodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP) are as follows:- \\n \\n• Surveys to assess the magnitude of the Iodine Deficiency Disorders. \\n \\n• Supply of iodated salt in place of common salt.'),\n",

At the time of independence  \\nmalaria was contributing 75 million cases with 0.8 million deaths every year prior to the \\nlaunching of National  Malaria Control Programme in 1953. A countrywide comprehensive \\nprogramme to control malaria was  recommended in 1946 by the Bhore committee report that  \\nwas endorsed by the Planning Commission in 1951. The national programme against malaria has  \\na long history since that time. In April 1953, Govt. of India launched a National Malaria Control  \\nProgramme (NMCP). \\nObjective: \\n \\n• To bring down malaria transmission to a level at which it would cease to be a major \\npublic health problem. \\n2) Kala -Azar Control Programme \\nKala-azar or visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a chronic disease caused by an intracellular protozoan \\n(Leishmania species) and transmitted to man by bite of female phlebotomus sand fly. Currently, \\nit is a main problem in Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and some parts of Uttar Pradesh. In view  \\nof the growing problem planned control measures were initiated to control kala-azar. \\nObjectives: \\nThe strategy for kala-azar control broadly included three main activities. \\n \\n• Interruption of transmission by reducing vector population through indoor residual \\ninsecticides. \\n• Early diagnosis and complete treatment of Kala-azar cases; and \\n• Health education programme for community awareness. \\n \\n3) National Filaria Control Programme \\nBancroftian filariasis caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, which is transmitted to man by the bites of \\ninfected mosquitoes - Culex, Anopheles, Mansonia and Aedes. Lymphatia filaria is prevalent in  \\n18 states and union territories. Bancroftian filariasis is widely distributed while brugian filariasis  \\ncaused by Brugia malayi is restricted to 7 states - UP, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Tamil  \\nNadu, Kerala, and Gujarat.

However, the programme has been extended to  \\nrural areas since 1994. \\nObjectives: \\n \\n• Reduction of the problem in un-surveyed areas \\n• Control in urban areas through recurrent anti-larval and anti-parasitic measures. \\n \\n4) Japanese Encephalitis Control Programme \\nJapanese encephalitis (JE) is a zoonotic disease and caused by an arbovirus, group B (Flavivirus)  \\nand transmitted by Culex mosquitoes. This disease has been reported from 26 states and UTs  \\nsince 1978, only 15 states are reporting JE regularly. The case fatality in India is 35% which can  \\nbe reduced by early detection, immediate  referral to hospital and proper medical and nursing  \\ncare. The total population at risk is estimated 160 million. The most disturbing feature of JE has  \\nbeen the regular occurrence of outbreak in different parts of the country. \\nGovt. of India has constituted a Task Force at National Level which is in operation and reviews  \\nthe JE situations and its control strategies from time to time. Though Directorate of National  \\nAnti-Malaria Programme is monitoring JE situation in the country. \\nObjectives: \\n \\n• Strengthening early diagnosis and prompt case management at PHCs, CHCs and \\nhospitals through training of medical and nursing staff. \\n• IEC for community awareness to promote early case reporting, personal protection, \\nisolation of amplifier host, etc.; \\n• Vector control measures mainly fogging during outbreaks, space spraying in animal \\ndwellings, and antilarval operation where feasible; and \\n• Development of a safe and standard indigenous vaccine. Vaccination for high risk \\npopulation particularly children below 15 years of age. \\n5) Dengue And Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever \\nOne of the most important resurgent tropical infectious diseases is dengue. Dengue Fever and  \\nDengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) are acute fevers caused by four antigenically related but  \\ndistinct dengue virus serotypes (DEN 1,2,3 and 4) transmitted by the infected mosquitoes, Aedes  \\naegypti. Dengue outbreaks have been reported from urban areas from all states. All the four  \\nserotypes of dengue virus (1,2,3 and 4) exist in India. The Vector Aedes Aegypti breed in  \\nperidomestic fresh water collections and is found in both urban and rural areas. \\nObjectives: \\n \\n• Surveillance for disease and outbreaks'),\n",

This act recommends that the  \\nCentral Government provide social security schemes to mitigate risks due to disability, health  \\nshocks, maternity and old age which all unorganized workers get exposed to and are likely to  \\nsuffer from. In India more  than two thirs of expenditure on health  is through Out of Pocket  \\n(OOP) which is the most ineficient and least accountable way of spending on health. Suppy side  \\nfinancing on health alone has not been found to be successful in reducing OOP expenditure on  \\nhealth substantially and therefore, to test the demand side financing approach, Government of  \\nIndia, decided to introduce Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) a Health Insurance \\nScheme for the Below Poverty Line families with the objectives to reduce OOP expenditure on  \\nhealth and increase access to health care \\n \\nType of scheme: Central Sector Scheme \\nYear of Commencement: 2008 \\nObjectives of the scheme: \\nThe main objective of RSBY scheme is to provide the enrolled beneficiaries from the \\nunorganized sector with a health insurance cover, thereby protecting them from the financial  \\nshocks arising out of an  emergency medical situation. It  aims to reduce the out of pocket  \\nexpenses of the target population for every visit to hospital. \\n \\nSalient features: \\n \\nThe beneficiary shall be eligible for such in - patient health care insurance benefits as would be  \\ndesigned by the respective State Governments based on the requirement of the people/ \\ngeographical area.  However, the State Governments are  advised to incorporate at least the \\nfollowing minimum benefits in the package / scheme: \\n• The unroganised sector worker and his family (unit of five) will be covered. \\n• Total sum insured would be Rs. 30,000/- per family per annum on a family floater basis. \\n• Cashless attendance to all covered ailments \\n• Hospitalization expenses, taking care of most common illnesses with as few exclusions as \\npossible \\n• All pre-existing diseases to be covered \\n• Transportation costs (actual with maximum limit of Rs. 100 per visit) within an overall \\nlimit of Rs. 1000. \\nFunding Pattern:'),\n",

It is mainly a rural based sector which has  its reach in backward and in-accessible \\nareas. Originally, handicraft started as a part time activity in the rural areas, however it has now  \\ntransformed into a flourishing economic activity due to significant market demand over the  \\nyears. Handicrafts have big potential as they hold the key for sustaining not only the existing set  \\nof millions of artisans, but also for increasingly large number of new entrants in the crafts  \\nactivity. Presently, handicraft sector is contributing substantially towards employment \\ngeneration and exports but this sector has suffered due to its unorganized nature  along with \\nadditional constraints like lack of education, capital, and poor exposure to new technologies,  \\nabsence of market intelligence and poor institutional framework. \\nThe National Handicraft Development Programme for development and promotion of \\nHandicrafts Sector has the following three components: \\nA.

MEGA CLUTER \\n \\nMega cluster approach is a Drive to scale up the infrastructural and production chain at \\nHandicrafts clusters which have remained unorganized and have not kept pace with the \\nmodernization and development that have been taking place so far. Consequently, there has not  \\nbeen any addition of fresh impetus of development and optimum realization of output in the  \\nhandicrafts sector, which  is not only the backbone of long traditional heritage  and cultural  \\nlinkages. \\n \\nThe prospect of this  sector lies  in infrastructural improvement, modernization of the  tools, \\nmachinery, process and product diversification and creating strong brands. Innovative designs as  \\nwell as technical know -how, furthered by brand building of the native products hold the key to  \\ncreating a niche market for the products manufactured by the clusters. The proposed programme  \\nis expected to support the Up gradation of infrastructural facilities coupled with market linkages  \\nand product development & diversification. \\n \\nHandicrafts clusters are located in clearly  identifiable geographical locations (clusters) that \\nspecialize in specific products, with close linkages and inter dependence amongst the key players \\nin the cluster. \\n \\nFurther, during implementation of the Mega Cluster projects it has been observed that in certain  \\ncases interventions are required to be implemented at various places throughout the country in a  \\nparticular craft for generating employment through skill up -gradation and also for increasing the  \\nmarket base of the craft within the country as well as in the International market. In such cases  \\nthe mega Cluster Scheme would be flexible to reach all corners of the country wherever the  \\nselected craft exists. The activities may vary from soft to hard interventions. In short, Mega  \\nClusters can be implemented in a fixed geographical area as well as different places throughout  \\nthe country in a particular craft or in a state where crafts are identified on block/cluster level. \\n \\nThe Mega Clusters will be taken up for development through Handicrafts Mega Cluster Mission  \\n(HMCM) or through Central/State Corporations as and when announced in Union Budget or as  \\nper requirement and as per the DPR prepared for the purpose. \\n \\nThe broad objectives of the proposed program are as follows: i. To enhance the competitiveness  \\nof selected clusters in terms of increased market share and ensuring increased productivity by  \\nhigher unit value realization of the products. ii.
